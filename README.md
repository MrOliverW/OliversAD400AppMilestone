Oliver’s App Launch 
Project Milestones Defined

The Oliver’s App Launch Project looks to see the successful creation and deployment of a really cool smartphone app. Over the course of about a year this project seeks to go from nothing to 1,000 active users with overwhelmingly positive feedback.

To start, we will be defining our brand and what we stand for. In the process we will develop a sustainable business plan with the help of our operations team which includes the founders, engineers, and business development specialists. We are a lean team and aim to muster the best team with the least resources, we are even considering open sourcing the project. 
Once we have our short, medium, and long term plan solidified we will develop the MVP (minimum viable product). Once the operations team is satisfied with the quality of the MVP we will being beta testing that product and use that feedback to create a 2nd draft of the product which should resemble the final product. With the help of our QA department and internal testers we will work out any issues or undesirable features in the 2nd draft. Once that’s done it will be released to the internal testing team and external beta testers.
Following this our development team will fine tune the product, with the help of the testing team until it is ready to be officially released. Once the product reaches 1,000 all internal employees will go to Hawaii for a company celebration.
